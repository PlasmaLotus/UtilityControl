-----------------------------
Outcast Outback Entities Pack
-----------------------------

1. Put the .zip in the Mods folder <- if you want to play Outcast Outback, do only this
IF YOU WANT TO INCLUDE IT IN YOUR MAP:
2. Add a dependency to the OutbackHelper like so:

- Name: OutcastOutback (Your mod's name)
  Version: 1.0.0 (Your mod's version)
  Dependencies:
    - Name: Everest
      Version: 1.525.0 (Everest version your mod runs on, at least 525
    - Name: CavernHelper
      Version: 1.0.0

3. Restart Ahorn for the entities/trigger list to update
(You can use the debug dropdown if you have it enabled)

Additional notes/warnings:
  - Portals are weird.
  - If you only have one portal it will crash your game if you go through it.
  - You can have multiple portals but it will pick only one permanent pair,
    so the only use for multiple portals would be using them in cassette blocks.
    They disappear with the cassette blocks.

Credit would be appreciated, but you're free to use / alter the entities as you wish.

Cool people you should thank:
Exudias,
the devs of Celeste, 0x0ade, Cruor, Vexatos,
and everyone else in the Mt. Celeste Climbing Association!
