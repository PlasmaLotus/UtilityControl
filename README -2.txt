Outcast Outback Entities Pack
-----------------------------

1. Put all the files from this .zip into your mod. Overwrite any files.
2. Make your everest.yaml look like this:

- Name: YourModHere
  Version: ...
  ...

- Name: OutbackHelper
  Version: 1.0.0
  DLL: OutbackHelper.dll
  Dependencies:
    - Name: Everest
      Version: 1.525.0

3. Restart Ahorn.

Additional notes/warnings:
  - Portals are weird.
  - If you only have one portal it will crash your game if you go through it.
  - You can have multiple portals but it will pick only one permanent pair,
    so the only use for multiple portals would be using them in cassette blocks.
    They disappear with the cassette blocks.

Credit would be appreciated, but you're free to use / alter the entities as you wish.

Cool people you should thank:
Exudias,
the devs of Celeste, 0x0ade, Cruor, Vexatos,
and everyone else in the Mt. Celeste Climbing Association!
